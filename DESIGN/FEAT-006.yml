  title: "Default startup key/mode = C minor"
  created: "2025-10-22"
rationale: "Improve first-run UX by starting in a musically common key with a minor mode default, reducing clicks to first sound."
ui:
  components:
    - id: "App"
      states: [idle, generating, ready, playing, error]
data: {}
logic:
  state_machine:
    states: [idle, generating, ready, playing, error]
    transitions:
      idle->generating: "User clicks Generate with defaults (C/minor)"
      generating->ready: "Progression generated in C minor"
dev:
  files_to_touch:
    - "src/App.tsx"
    - "tests/e2e/default-key.test.tsx"
  scripts:
    dev: "pnpm dev"
    test: "pnpm test"
acceptance_tests:
  - "Given a fresh load, when Generate is clicked, the UI shows 'C minor' for key/mode."
non_goals:
  - "Changing available keys/modes"
  - "Persisting user selection across reloads"
risks:
  - "If other features assume different defaults, ensure tests reference explicit values"
